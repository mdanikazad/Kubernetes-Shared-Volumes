# Kubernetes-Shared-Volumes

We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.


Create a pod named volume-share-devops.

For first container, use image debian with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e debian:latest, container should be named as volume-container-devops-1, and run a command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/official.

For second container, use image debian with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e debian:latest, container should be named as volume-container-devops-2, and run a command '/bin/bash', 'c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/cluster.

Volumes to be named as volume-share and use emptyDir: { }.

After creating pods, exec into the first container volume-container-devops-1, and create a file official.txt with content Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries! under the mount path of first container i.e /tmp/official.

The file official.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/cluster of second container volume-container-devops-2 as they are using shared volumes.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


# Answer


 Step 1: kubectl create -f <this file>
 Step 2: Wait for the pod to be in running state
 Step 3: Get a shell to the first container in the pod:
         kubectl exec volume-share-devops --container volume-container-devops-1 -- /bin/bash
Step 4: In the resulting prompt, create a text file as per the question:
         echo "Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!" > /tmp/ecommerce/ecommerce.txt
 Step 5: Verify: Check that you are able to see this file in the second container
         under corresponding volume mount path as they use shared volumes:
         kubectl exec volume-share-devops --container volume-container-devops-2 --
         cat /tmp/apps/ecommerce.txt
